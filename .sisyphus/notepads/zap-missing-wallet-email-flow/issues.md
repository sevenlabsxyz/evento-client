## 2026-02-14 Task: Initial Analysis

- Task 5 (Trigger.dev + email templates) is backend-only work — no Trigger.dev in client repo. This task will create the API route handler in the client that calls the backend endpoint, but the actual Trigger.dev task + email templates live in the backend repo. Plan scope for client: create the API contract and mutation hook only.
